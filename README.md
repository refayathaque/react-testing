## React Testing with Jest & Enzyme, with Redux, Hooks & Context
* January 2, 2020*

### Why is testing important?
- Better organization, more maintainable & fewer bugs

### TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- Write tests *before* writing code
- "Red-Green Testing"
  - Tests will fail before code is written, write code around making tests pass
- TDD is is more efficient, makes you write *better* code (bc you have to plan before you code), results in fewer bugs (caught sooner) and forces good code coverage

### Jest
- Comes with `create-react-app`
